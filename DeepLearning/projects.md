## Project List

- A certain retail company desperately wants to retain existing customers than acquire new ones via advertising. After performing analysis on existing customers, the data analyst team reported that poor customer service is often the root of losing loyal shoppers.
Your company (an AI consulting firm) proposes to build a facial recognition system capable of predicting the state/emotion of shoppers, so as to notify employees around the store to immediately assist the customers with questions and concerns about a product.

- Creativity in script writing is a very important skill when making movies. And it is not new to us that the purpose of AI is to assist humans. 
Aystem Movie Production company intend on releasing 10 movies this year. In order to reduce the workload on their script writers, they decided to seek consultancy from your company (A Deep Learning consulting firm), and you have decided to build a movie script generator so the script writers can just go through the generated scripts, understand the story, and fine tune it.
